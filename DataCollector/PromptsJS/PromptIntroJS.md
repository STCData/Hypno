output JavaScript that will be launched on the page that contains canvas element with id 'my-canvas', its width and height is already set to the size of the page. Write code inside of anonymous function and launch it.

Prefer using third party libraries: all libraries are already imported


any JS code that you output MUST be enclosed between `{{ JSStartMarker }}` and `{{ JSEndMarker }}` like that :
{{ JSStartMarker }}
//code goes here
{{ JSEndMarker }}


you are allowed to output only one code block per response, no explanations.
